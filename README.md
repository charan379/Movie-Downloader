Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017)

When a young nun at a cloistered abbey in Romania
takes her own life, a priest with a haunted past
and a novitiate on the threshold of her final vows
are sent by the Vatican to investigate. Together
they uncover the orderâ€™s unholy secret. Risking
not only their lives but their faith and their
very souls, they confront a malevolent ...

TS | 7.9 stars
**************************************************
Enter a number to load that movie or 0 to load next page or q to quit
```

The only difference in both these type of results is the presence of picture
quality. In both cases, the rating is out of 10 stars.

At the prompt if you enter 0 then the next page is loaded (if present) and if
you input a valid movie number, then the script initiates download if the "-d"
flag is specified else there's another yes/no confirmation to download the
movie. If y/Y is entered then again download is initiated else the movie is
openend in a new browser tab.

All downloads happen in the directory where the script resides.

5 wrong inputs terminates the script.

## Regarding development env and bugs

This script has been developed and tested on python 3.7.0 running on an Arch
Linux x86_64 machine and is expected to run on python 3.5.x and above.

Incase of any issue with script, do raise an issue on the repository.

Thanks for using the script :)
